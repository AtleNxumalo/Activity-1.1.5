## Overview

The CalculatorApp is a basic Android calculator application built using Kotlin in Android Studio. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division.

It also includes a clear button to reset the calculator and handles edge cases like division by zero.

## Features include: 
- Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are fundamental mathematical operations.
- Resets the input and clears the result using a clear button.
- Shows the results of ongoing computations in a TextView.
- Provides an error message when handling incorrect operations, such as division by zero.

 ## UI Design:
 - Makes use of buttons for numbers, operators, equals, and the clear button, as well as a TextView for calculating results.
 - For layout, either a ConstraintLayout or a LinearLayout is used.

 ## Functionality:
 - Contains edge case management, button interactions, computation performance, and unambiguous functionality.
 - Manages incorrect inputs and division by zero.

 ## Testing: 
 - Verifies that all of the buttons work as intended by running the app on a real device or on an Android emulator.
 - Ensures clear button reset, error handling for edge circumstances, and accurate computations.
